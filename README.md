# Simple Blockchain Simulation

## Overview
This is a simple blockchain simulation written in Python that demonstrates the core concepts of blockchain, including block structure, hashing, proof-of-work, and chain validation.

## Features
- Block Structure with transactions, hash, and previous hash.
- SHA-256 hashing to ensure data integrity.
- Proof-of-Work to simulate computational effort in block creation.
- Chain validation to detect tampered blocks.
- Dynamic transaction addition.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python testProject.py
